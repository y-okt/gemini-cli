description="Injects context of all relevant cli files"
prompt = """
The following output contains the complete
source code of the gemini cli library (`packages/cli`), and {packages/core} and representative test files
(`packages/cli/src/ui/components/InputPrompt.test.tsx` and `packages/cli/src/ui/App.test.tsx`) that best conform to the project's testing standards.
**Pay extremely close attention to these files.** They define the project's
core architecture, component patterns, and testing standards.

The source code contains the content of absolutely every source code file in
packages/cli and packages/core. In addition to the source code, the following test files are
included as they are test files that conform to the project's testing standards:
`packages/cli/src/ui/components/InputPrompt.test.tsx` and `packages/cli/src/ui/App.test.tsx`.
You should very rarely need to read any other files from packages/cli to resolve
prompts.

In addition to the code context, you MUST strictly adhere to the following frontend-specific development guidelines when writing code in packages/cli.
